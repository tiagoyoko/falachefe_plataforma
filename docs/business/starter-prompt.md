I'm working with an agentic coding boilerplate project that includes authentication, database integration, and AI capabilities. Here's what's already set up:

## Current Agentic Coding Boilerplate Structure

- **Authentication**: Better Auth with Google OAuth integration
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL setup
- **AI Integration**: Vercel AI SDK with OpenAI integration
- **UI**: shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS
- **Current Routes**:
  - `/` - Home page with setup instructions and feature overview
  - `/dashboard` - Protected dashboard page (requires authentication)
  - `/chat` - AI chat interface (requires OpenAI API key)

## Important Context

This is an **agentic coding boilerplate/starter template** - all existing pages and components are meant to be examples and should be **completely replaced** to build the actual AI-powered application.

### CRITICAL: You MUST Override All Boilerplate Content

**DO NOT keep any boilerplate components, text, or UI elements unless explicitly requested.** This includes:

- **Remove all placeholder/demo content** (setup checklists, welcome messages, boilerplate text)
- **Replace the entire navigation structure** - don't keep the existing site header or nav items
- **Override all page content completely** - don't append to existing pages, replace them entirely
- **Remove or replace all example components** (setup-checklist, starter-prompt-modal, etc.)
- **Replace placeholder routes and pages** with the actual application functionality

### Required Actions:

1. **Start Fresh**: Treat existing components as temporary scaffolding to be removed
2. **Complete Replacement**: Build the new application from scratch using the existing tech stack
3. **No Hybrid Approach**: Don't try to integrate new features alongside existing boilerplate content
4. **Clean Slate**: The final application should have NO trace of the original boilerplate UI or content

The only things to preserve are:

- **All installed libraries and dependencies** (DO NOT uninstall or remove any packages from package.json)
- **Authentication system** (but customize the UI/flow as needed)
- **Database setup and schema** (but modify schema as needed for your use case)
- **Core configuration files** (next.config.ts, tsconfig.json, tailwind.config.ts, etc.)
- **Build and development scripts** (keep all npm/pnpm scripts in package.json)

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 15 with App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Better Auth for authentication
- Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL
- Vercel AI SDK
- shadcn/ui components
- Lucide React icons

## Component Development Guidelines

**Always prioritize shadcn/ui components** when building the application:

1. **First Choice**: Use existing shadcn/ui components from the project
2. **Second Choice**: Install additional shadcn/ui components using `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component-name>`
3. **Last Resort**: Only create custom components or use other libraries if shadcn/ui doesn't provide a suitable option

The project already includes several shadcn/ui components (button, dialog, avatar, etc.) and follows their design system. Always check the [shadcn/ui documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components) for available components before implementing alternatives.

## Request

Please help me transform this boilerplate into my actual application. **You MUST completely replace all existing boilerplate code** to match my project requirements. The current implementation is just temporary scaffolding that should be entirely removed and replaced.

## Final Reminder: COMPLETE REPLACEMENT REQUIRED

ðŸš¨ **IMPORTANT**: Do not preserve any of the existing boilerplate UI, components, or content. The user expects a completely fresh application that implements their requirements from scratch. Any remnants of the original boilerplate (like setup checklists, welcome screens, demo content, or placeholder navigation) indicate incomplete implementation.

**Success Criteria**: The final application should look and function as if it was built from scratch for the specific use case, with no evidence of the original boilerplate template.

## Post-Implementation Documentation

After completing the implementation, you MUST document any new features or significant changes in the `/docs/features/` directory:

1. **Create Feature Documentation**: For each major feature implemented, create a markdown file in `/docs/features/` that explains:

   - What the feature does
   - How it works
   - Key components and files involved
   - Usage examples
   - Any configuration or setup required

2. **Update Existing Documentation**: If you modify existing functionality, update the relevant documentation files to reflect the changes.

3. **Document Design Decisions**: Include any important architectural or design decisions made during implementation.

This documentation helps maintain the project and assists future developers working with the codebase.
